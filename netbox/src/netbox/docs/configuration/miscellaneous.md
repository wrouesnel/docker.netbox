---

## BANNER_BOTTOM

!!! tip "Dynamic Configuration Parameter"

Sets content for the bottom banner in the user interface.

---

## BANNER_LOGIN

!!! tip "Dynamic Configuration Parameter"

This defines custom content to be displayed on the login page above the login form. HTML is allowed.

---

## BANNER_MAINTENANCE

!!! tip "Dynamic Configuration Parameter"

This adds a banner to the top of every page when maintenance mode is enabled. HTML is allowed.

---

## BANNER_TOP

!!! tip "Dynamic Configuration Parameter"

Sets content for the top banner in the user interface.

!!! tip
    If you'd like the top and bottom banners to match, set the following:

    ```python
    BANNER_TOP = 'Your banner text'
    BANNER_BOTTOM = BANNER_TOP
    ```

---

## COPILOT_ENABLED

!!! tip "Dynamic Configuration Parameter"

Default: `True`

Enables or disables the [NetBox Copilot](https://netboxlabs.com/docs/copilot/) agent globally. When enabled, users can opt to toggle the agent individually.

---

## CENSUS_REPORTING_ENABLED

Default: `True`

Enables anonymous census reporting. To opt out of census reporting, set this to `False`.

This data enables the project maintainers to estimate how many NetBox deployments exist and track the adoption of new versions over time. Census reporting effects a single HTTP request each time a worker starts. The only data reported by this function are the NetBox version, Python version, and a pseudorandom unique identifier.

---

## CHANGELOG_RETENTION

!!! tip "Dynamic Configuration Parameter"

Default: `90`

The number of days to retain logged changes (object creations, updates, and deletions). Set this to `0` to retain
changes in the database indefinitely.

!!! warning
    If enabling indefinite changelog retention, it is recommended to periodically delete old entries. Otherwise, the database may eventually exceed capacity.

---

## CHANGELOG_SKIP_EMPTY_CHANGES

Default: `True`

If enabled, a change log record will not be created when an object is updated without any changes to its existing field values.

!!! note
    The object's `last_updated` field will always reflect the time of the most recent update, regardless of this parameter.

---

## DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE

Default: `2621440` (2.5 MB)

The maximum size (in bytes) of an incoming HTTP request (i.e. `GET` or `POST` data). Requests which exceed this size will raise a `RequestDataTooBig` exception.

---

## ENFORCE_GLOBAL_UNIQUE

!!! tip "Dynamic Configuration Parameter"

Default: `True`

By default, NetBox will prevent the creation of duplicate prefixes and IP addresses in the global table (that is, those which are not assigned to any VRF). This validation can be disabled by setting `ENFORCE_GLOBAL_UNIQUE` to `False`.

---

## EVENTS_PIPELINE

Default: `['extras.events.process_event_queue',]`

NetBox will call dotted paths to the functions listed here for events (create, update, delete) on models as well as when custom EventRules are fired.

---

## FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE

Default: `2621440` (2.5 MB)

The maximum amount (in bytes) of uploaded data that will be held in memory before being written to the filesystem. Changing this setting can be useful for example to be able to upload files bigger than 2.5MB to custom scripts for processing.

---

## JOB_RETENTION

!!! tip "Dynamic Configuration Parameter"

Default: `90`

The number of days to retain job results (scripts and reports). Set this to `0` to retain job results in the database indefinitely.

!!! warning
    If enabling indefinite job results retention, it is recommended to periodically delete old entries. Otherwise, the database may eventually exceed capacity.

---

## MAINTENANCE_MODE

!!! tip "Dynamic Configuration Parameter"

Default: `False`

Setting this to `True` will display a "maintenance mode" banner at the top of every page. Additionally, NetBox will no longer update a user's "last active" time upon login. This is to allow new logins when the database is in a read-only state. Recording of login times will resume when maintenance mode is disabled.

---

## MAPS_URL

!!! tip "Dynamic Configuration Parameter"

Default: `https://maps.google.com/?q=` (Google Maps)

This specifies the URL to use when presenting a map of a physical location by street address or GPS coordinates. The URL must accept either a free-form street address or a comma-separated pair of numeric coordinates appended to it. Set this to `None` to disable the "map it" button within the UI.

---

## MAX_PAGE_SIZE

!!! tip "Dynamic Configuration Parameter"

Default: `1000`

Defines the maximum number of objects that may be returned in a single page across the web UI, REST API, and GraphQL API. Setting `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` to `0` or `None` removes the limit.

See the [REST API](../integrations/rest-api.md#pagination) and [GraphQL API](../integrations/graphql-api.md#pagination) pagination documentation for details.

---

## METRICS_ENABLED

Default: `False`

Toggle the availability Prometheus-compatible metrics at `/metrics`. See the [Prometheus Metrics](../integrations/prometheus-metrics.md) documentation for more details.

---

## PREFER_IPV4

!!! tip "Dynamic Configuration Parameter"

Default: `False`

When determining the primary IP address for a device, IPv6 is preferred over IPv4 by default. Set this to `True` to prefer IPv4 instead.

---

## QUEUE_MAPPINGS

Allows changing which queues are used internally for background tasks.

```python
QUEUE_MAPPINGS = {
    'webhook': 'low',
    'report': 'high',
    'script': 'high',
}
```

If no queue is defined the queue named `default` will be used.

---

## RELEASE_CHECK_URL

Default: `None` (disabled)

This parameter defines the URL of the repository that will be checked for new NetBox releases. When a new release is detected, a message will be displayed to administrative users on the home page. This can be set to the official repository (`'https://api.github.com/repos/netbox-community/netbox/releases'`) or a custom fork. Set this to `None` to disable automatic update checks.

!!! note
    The URL provided **must** be compatible with the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

---

## RQ

Default: `{}` (Empty)

This is a wrapper for passing global configuration parameters to [Django RQ](https://github.com/rq/django-rq) to customize its behavior. It is employed within NetBox primarily to alter conditions during testing.

---

## RQ_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT

Default: `300`

The maximum execution time of a background task (such as running a custom script), in seconds.

---

## RQ_RETRY_INTERVAL

Default: `60`

This parameter controls how frequently a failed job is retried, up to the maximum number of times specified by `RQ_RETRY_MAX`. This must be either an integer specifying the number of seconds to wait between successive attempts, or a list of such values. For example, `[60, 300, 3600]` will retry the task after 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 1 hour.

---

## RQ_RETRY_MAX

Default: `0` (retries disabled)

The maximum number of times a background task will be retried before being marked as failed.

## DISK_BASE_UNIT

Default: `1000`

The base unit for disk sizes. Set this to `1024` to use binary prefixes (MiB, GiB, etc.) instead of decimal prefixes (MB, GB, etc.).

## RAM_BASE_UNIT

Default: `1000`

The base unit for RAM sizes. Set this to `1024` to use binary prefixes (MiB, GiB, etc.) instead of decimal prefixes (MB, GB, etc.).

# Security & Authentication Parameters

## ALLOWED_URL_SCHEMES

!!! tip "Dynamic Configuration Parameter"

Default: `('file', 'ftp', 'ftps', 'http', 'https', 'irc', 'mailto', 'sftp', 'ssh', 'tel', 'telnet', 'tftp', 'vnc', 'xmpp')`

A list of permitted URL schemes referenced when rendering links within NetBox. Note that only the schemes specified in this list will be accepted: If adding your own, be sure to replicate all the default values as well (excluding those schemes which are not desirable).

---

## AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS

This parameter acts as a pass-through for configuring Django's built-in password validators for local user accounts. These rules are applied whenever a user's password is created or updated to ensure that it meets minimum criteria such as length or complexity. The default configuration is shown below.

```python
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "min_length": 12,
        },
    },
    {
        "NAME": "utilities.password_validation.AlphanumericPasswordValidator",
    },
]
```

The default configuration enforces the follow criteria:

* A password must be at least 12 characters in length.
* A password must have at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one numeric digit.

Although it is not recommended, the default validation rules can be disabled by setting `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = []` in the configuration file. For more detail on customizing password validation, please see [the Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/auth/passwords/#password-validation).

## CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL

Default: `False`

If `True`, cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) requests will be accepted from all origins. If False, a whitelist will be used (see below).

---

## CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST

## CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX_WHITELIST

These settings specify a list of origins that are authorized to make cross-site API requests. Use
`CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST` to define a list of exact hostnames, or `CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX_WHITELIST` to define a set of regular 
expressions. (These settings have no effect if `CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL` is `True`.) For example:

```python
CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST = [
    'https://example.com',
]
```

---

## CSRF_COOKIE_NAME

Default: `csrftoken`

The name of the cookie to use for the cross-site request forgery (CSRF) authentication token. See the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#csrf-cookie-name) for more detail.

---

## CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE

Default: `False`

If `True`, the cookie employed for cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection will be marked as secure, meaning that it can only be sent across an HTTPS connection.

---

## CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS

Default: `[]`

Defines a list of trusted origins for unsafe (e.g. `POST`) requests. This is a pass-through to Django's [`CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#csrf-trusted-origins) setting. Note that each host listed must specify a scheme (e.g. `http://` or `https://`).

```python
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = (
    'http://netbox.local',
    'https://netbox.local',
)
```

---

## DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS

Default:

```python
{
    'users.view_token': ({'user': '$user'},),
    'users.add_token': ({'user': '$user'},),
    'users.change_token': ({'user': '$user'},),
    'users.delete_token': ({'user': '$user'},),
}
```

This parameter defines object permissions that are applied automatically to _any_ authenticated user, regardless of what permissions have been defined in the database. By default, this parameter is defined to allow all users to manage their own API tokens, however it can be overriden for any purpose.

For example, to allow all users to create a device role beginning with the word "temp," you could configure the following:

```python
DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS = {
    'dcim.add_devicerole': (
        {'name__startswith': 'temp'},
    )
}
```

!!! warning
    Setting a custom value for this parameter will overwrite the default permission mapping shown above. If you want to retain the default mapping, be sure to reproduce it in your custom configuration.

---

## EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS

Default: `[]` (Empty list)

A list of NetBox models to exempt from the enforcement of view permissions. Models listed here will be viewable by all users, both authenticated and anonymous.

List models in the form `<app>.<model>`. For example:

```python
EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS = [
    'dcim.site',
    'dcim.region',
    'ipam.prefix',
]
```

To exempt _all_ models from view permission enforcement, set the following. (Note that `EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS` must be an iterable.)

```python
EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS = ['*']
```

!!! note
    Using a wildcard will not affect certain potentially sensitive models, such as user permissions. If there is a need to exempt these models, they must be specified individually.

---

## LOGIN_PERSISTENCE

Default: `False`

If `True`, the lifetime of a user's authentication session will be automatically reset upon each valid request. For example, if [`LOGIN_TIMEOUT`](#login_timeout) is configured to 14 days (the default), and a user whose session is due to expire in five days makes a NetBox request (with a valid session cookie), the session's lifetime will be reset to 14 days.

Note that enabling this setting causes NetBox to update a user's session in the database (or file, as configured per [`SESSION_FILE_PATH`](#session_file_path)) with each request, which may introduce significant overhead in very active environments. It also permits an active user to remain authenticated to NetBox indefinitely.

---

## LOGIN_REQUIRED

Default: `True`

When enabled, only authenticated users are permitted to access any part of NetBox. Disabling this will allow unauthenticated users to access most areas of NetBox (but not make any changes).

!!! info "Changed in NetBox v4.0.2"
    Prior to NetBox v4.0.2, this setting was disabled by default.

---

## LOGIN_TIMEOUT

Default: `1209600` seconds (14 days)

The lifetime (in seconds) of the authentication cookie issued to a NetBox user upon login.

---

## LOGIN_FORM_HIDDEN

Default: `False`

Option to hide the login form when only SSO authentication is in use. 

!!! warning
    If the SSO provider is unreachable, login to NetBox will be impossible if this option is enabled. The only recourse is to disable it in the local configuration and restart the NetBox service.

---

## LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL

Default: `'home'`

The view name or URL to which a user is redirected after logging out.

---

## SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS

Default: `False`

If `True`, the `includeSubDomains` directive will be included in the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header. This directive instructs the browser to apply the HSTS policy to all subdomains of the current domain.

---

## SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD

Default: `False`

If `True`, the `preload` directive will be included in the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header. This directive instructs the browser to preload the site in HTTPS. Browsers that use the HSTS preload list will force the site to be accessed via HTTPS even if the user types HTTP in the address bar.

---

## SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS

Default: `0`

If set to a non-zero integer value, the SecurityMiddleware sets the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header on all responses that do not already have it. This will instruct the browser that the website must be accessed via HTTPS, blocking any HTTP request.

---

## SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT

Default: `False`

If `True`, all non-HTTPS requests will be automatically redirected to use HTTPS.

!!! warning
    Ensure that your frontend HTTP daemon has been configured to forward the HTTP scheme correctly before enabling this option. An incorrectly configured frontend may result in a looping redirect.

---

## SESSION_COOKIE_NAME

Default: `sessionid`

The name used for the session cookie. See the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#session-cookie-name) for more detail.

---

## SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE

Default: `False`

If `True`, the cookie employed for session authentication will be marked as secure, meaning that it can only be sent across an HTTPS connection.

---

## SESSION_FILE_PATH

Default: `None`

HTTP session data is used to track authenticated users when they access NetBox. By default, NetBox stores session data in its PostgreSQL database. However, this inhibits authentication to a standby instance of NetBox without write access to the database. Alternatively, a local file path may be specified here and NetBox will store session data as files instead of using the database. Note that the NetBox system user must have read and write permissions to this path.

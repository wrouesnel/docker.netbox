# NetBox Installation

This section of the documentation discusses installing and configuring the NetBox application itself.

## Install System Packages

Begin by installing all system packages required by NetBox and its dependencies.

!!! warning "Python 3.12 or later required"
    NetBox supports only Python 3.12 or later.

```no-highlight
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev \
build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libffi-dev libpq-dev \
libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
```

Before continuing, check that your installed Python version is at least 3.12:

```no-highlight
python3 -V
```

## Download NetBox

This documentation provides two options for installing NetBox: from a downloadable archive, or from the git repository. Installing from a package (option A below) requires manually fetching and extracting the archive for every future update, whereas installation via git (option B) allows for seamless upgrades by checking out the latest release tag.

### Option A: Download a Release Archive

Download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases) from GitHub as a tarball or ZIP archive and extract it to your desired path. In this example, we'll use `/opt/netbox` as the NetBox root.

```no-highlight
sudo wget https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/archive/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
sudo tar -xzf vX.Y.Z.tar.gz -C /opt
sudo ln -s /opt/netbox-X.Y.Z/ /opt/netbox
```

!!! note
    It is recommended to install NetBox in a directory named for its version number. For example, NetBox v4.0.0 would be installed into `/opt/netbox-4.0.0`, and a symlink from `/opt/netbox/` would point to this location. (You can verify this configuration with the command `ls -l /opt | grep netbox`.) This allows for future releases to be installed in parallel without interrupting the current installation. When changing to the new release, only the symlink needs to be updated.

### Option B: Clone the Git Repository

Create the base directory for the NetBox installation. For this guide, we'll use `/opt/netbox`.

```no-highlight
sudo mkdir -p /opt/netbox/
cd /opt/netbox/
```

If `git` is not already installed, install it:

```no-highlight
sudo apt install -y git
```

Next, clone the git repository:

```no-highlight
sudo git clone https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox.git .
```

This command should generate output similar to the following:

```
Cloning into '.'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 148317, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (183/183), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (115/115), done.
remote: Total 148317 (delta 127), reused 68 (delta 68), pack-reused 148134 (from 3)
Receiving objects: 100% (148317/148317), 165.12 MiB | 28.71 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (116428/116428), done.
```

Finally, check out the tag for the desired release. You can find these on our [releases page](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases). Replace `vX.Y.Z` with your selected release tag below.

```
sudo git checkout vX.Y.Z
```

Using this installation method enables easy upgrades in the future by simply checking out the latest release tag.

## Create the NetBox System User

Create a system user account named `netbox`. We'll configure the WSGI and HTTP services to run under this account. We'll also assign this user ownership of the media directory. This ensures that NetBox will be able to save uploaded files.

```
sudo adduser --system --group netbox
sudo chown --recursive netbox /opt/netbox/netbox/media/
sudo chown --recursive netbox /opt/netbox/netbox/reports/
sudo chown --recursive netbox /opt/netbox/netbox/scripts/
```

## Configuration

Move into the NetBox configuration directory and make a copy of `configuration_example.py` named `configuration.py`. This file will hold all of your local configuration parameters.

```no-highlight
cd /opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/
sudo cp configuration_example.py configuration.py
```

Open `configuration.py` with your preferred editor to begin configuring NetBox. NetBox offers [many configuration parameters](../configuration/index.md), but only the following four are required for new installations:

* `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
* `API_TOKEN_PEPPERS`
* `DATABASES`
* `REDIS`
* `SECRET_KEY`

### ALLOWED_HOSTS

This is a list of the valid hostnames and IP addresses by which this server can be reached. You must specify at least one name or IP address. (Note that this does not restrict the locations from which NetBox may be accessed: It is merely for [HTTP host header validation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/security/#host-headers-virtual-hosting).)

```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['netbox.example.com', '192.0.2.123']
```

If you are not yet sure what the domain name and/or IP address of the NetBox installation will be, you can set this to a wildcard (asterisk) to allow all host values:

```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
```

### API_TOKEN_PEPPERS

Define at least one random cryptographic pepper, identified by a numeric ID starting at 1. This will be used to generate SHA256 checksums for API tokens.

```python
API_TOKEN_PEPPERS = {
    # DO NOT USE THIS EXAMPLE PEPPER IN PRODUCTION
    1: 'kp7ht*76fiQAhUi5dHfASLlYUE_S^gI^(7J^K5M!LfoH@vl&b_',
}
```

!!! tip
    As with [`SECRET_KEY`](#secret_key) below, you can use the `generate_secret_key.py` script to generate a random pepper:
    ```no-highlight
    python3 ../generate_secret_key.py
    ```

### DATABASES

This parameter holds the PostgreSQL database configuration details. The default database must be defined; additional databases may be defined as needed e.g. by plugins.

A username and password must be defined for the default database. If the service is running on a remote host, update the `HOST` and `PORT` parameters accordingly. See the [configuration documentation](../configuration/required-parameters.md#databases) for more detail on individual parameters.

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'NAME': 'netbox',               # Database name
        'USER': 'netbox',               # PostgreSQL username
        'PASSWORD': 'J5brHrAXFLQSif0K', # PostgreSQL password
        'HOST': 'localhost',            # Database server
        'PORT': '',                     # Database port (leave blank for default)
        'CONN_MAX_AGE': 300,            # Max database connection age (seconds)
    }
}
```

### REDIS

Redis is an in-memory key-value store used by NetBox for caching and background task queuing. Redis typically requires minimal configuration; the values below should suffice for most installations. See the [configuration documentation](../configuration/required-parameters.md#redis) for more detail on individual parameters.

Note that NetBox requires the specification of two separate Redis databases: `tasks` and `caching`. These may both be provided by the same Redis service, however each should have a unique numeric database ID.

```python
REDIS = {
    'tasks': {
        'HOST': 'localhost',      # Redis server
        'PORT': 6379,             # Redis port
        'PASSWORD': '',           # Redis password (optional)
        'DATABASE': 0,            # Database ID
        'SSL': False,             # Use SSL (optional)
    },
    'caching': {
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': 6379,
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'DATABASE': 1,            # Unique ID for second database
        'SSL': False,
    }
}
```

### SECRET_KEY

This parameter must be assigned a randomly-generated key employed as a salt for hashing and related cryptographic functions. (Note, however, that it is _never_ directly used in the encryption of secret data.) This key must be unique to this installation and is recommended to be at least 50 characters long. It should not be shared outside the local system.

A simple Python script named `generate_secret_key.py` is provided in the parent directory to assist in generating a suitable key:

```no-highlight
python3 ../generate_secret_key.py
```

!!! warning "SECRET_KEY values must match"
    In the case of a highly available installation with multiple web servers, `SECRET_KEY` must be identical among all servers in order to maintain a persistent user session state.

When you have finished modifying the configuration, remember to save the file.

## Optional Requirements

All Python packages required by NetBox are listed in `requirements.txt` and will be installed automatically. NetBox also supports some optional packages. If desired, these packages must be listed in `local_requirements.txt` within the NetBox root directory.

### Remote File Storage

By default, NetBox will use the local filesystem to store uploaded files. To use a remote filesystem, install the [`django-storages`](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library and configure your [desired storage backend](../configuration/system.md#storages) in `configuration.py`.

```no-highlight
sudo sh -c "echo 'django-storages' >> /opt/netbox/local_requirements.txt"
```

### Remote Data Sources

NetBox supports integration with several remote data sources via configurable backends. Each of these requires the installation of one or more additional libraries.

* Amazon S3: [`boto3`](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
* Git: [`dulwich`](https://www.dulwich.io/)

For example, to enable the Amazon S3 backend, add `boto3` to your local requirements file:

```no-highlight
sudo sh -c "echo 'boto3' >> /opt/netbox/local_requirements.txt"
```

!!! info
    These packages were previously required in NetBox v3.5 but now are optional.

### Sentry Integration

NetBox may be configured to send error reports to [Sentry](../administration/error-reporting.md) for analysis. This integration requires installation of the `sentry-sdk` Python library.

```no-highlight
sudo sh -c "echo 'sentry-sdk' >> /opt/netbox/local_requirements.txt"
```

!!! info
    Sentry integration was previously included by default in NetBox v3.6 but is now optional.

## Run the Upgrade Script

Once NetBox has been configured, we're ready to proceed with the actual installation. We'll run the packaged upgrade script (`upgrade.sh`) to perform the following actions:

* Create a Python virtual environment
* Installs all required Python packages
* Run database schema migrations (skip with `--readonly`)
* Builds the documentation locally (for offline use)
* Aggregate static resource files on disk

!!! warning
    If you still have a Python virtual environment active from a previous installation step, disable it now by running the `deactivate` command. This will avoid errors on systems where `sudo` has been configured to preserve the user's current environment.

```no-highlight
sudo /opt/netbox/upgrade.sh
```

Note that **Python 3.12 or later is required** for NetBox v4.5 and later releases. If the default Python installation on your server is set to a lesser version, pass the path to the supported installation as an environment variable named `PYTHON`. (Note that the environment variable must be passed _after_ the `sudo` command.)

```no-highlight
sudo PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.12 /opt/netbox/upgrade.sh
```

!!! note
    Upon completion, the upgrade script may warn that no existing virtual environment was detected. As this is a new installation, this warning can be safely ignored.

!!! note
    To run the script on a node connected to a database in read-only mode, include the `--readonly` parameter. This will skip the application of any database migrations.

## Create a Super User

NetBox does not come with any predefined user accounts. You'll need to create a super user (administrative account) to be able to log into NetBox. First, enter the Python virtual environment created by the upgrade script:

```no-highlight
source /opt/netbox/venv/bin/activate
```

Once the virtual environment has been activated, you should notice the string `(venv)` prepended to your console prompt.

Next, we'll create a superuser account using the `createsuperuser` Django management command (via `manage.py`). Specifying an email address for the user is not required, but be sure to use a very strong password.

```no-highlight
cd /opt/netbox/netbox
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Test the Application

At this point, we should be able to run NetBox's development server for testing. We can check by starting a development instance locally.

!!! tip
    Check that the Python virtual environment is still active before attempting to run the server.

```no-highlight
python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 --insecure
```

If successful, you should see output similar to the following:

```no-highlight
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
January 26, 2026 - 17:00:00
Django version 5.2.10, using settings 'netbox.settings'
Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

Next, connect to the name or IP of the server (as defined in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`) on port 8000; for example, <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>. You should be greeted with the NetBox home page. Try logging in using the username and password specified when creating a superuser.

!!! danger "Not for production use"
    The development server is for development and testing purposes only. It is neither performant nor secure enough for production use. **Do not use it in production.**

!!! warning
    If the test service does not run, or you cannot reach the NetBox home page, something has gone wrong. Do not proceed with the rest of this guide until the installation has been corrected.

Type `Ctrl+c` to stop the development server.

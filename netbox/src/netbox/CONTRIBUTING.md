## :information_source: Welcome to the Stadium!

In her book [Working in Public](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software/dp/0578675862), Nadia Eghbal defines four production models for open source projects, categorized by contributor and user growth: federations, clubs, toys, and stadiums. The NetBox project fits her definition of a stadium very well:

> Stadiums are projects with low contributor growth and high user growth. While they may receive casual contributions, their regular contributor base does not grow proportionately to their users. As a result, they tend to be powered by one or a few developers.

The bulk of NetBox's development is carried out by a handful of core maintainers at [NetBox Labs](https://netboxlabs.com), with occasional contributions from collaborators in the community. We find the stadium analogy very useful in conveying the roles and obligations of both contributors and users.

If you're a contributor, actively working on the center stage, you have an obligation to produce quality content that will benefit the project as a whole. Conversely, if you're in the audience consuming the work being produced, you have the option of making requests and suggestions, but must also recognize that contributors are under no obligation to act on them.

NetBox users are welcome to participate in either role, on stage or in the crowd. We ask only that you acknowledge the role you've chosen and respect the roles of others.

### General Tips for Working on GitHub

* Register for a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you haven't already.
* You can use [GitHub Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for formatting text and adding images.
* To help mitigate notification spam, please avoid "bumping" issues with no activity. (To vote an issue up or down, use a :thumbsup: or :thumbsdown: reaction.)
* Please avoid pinging members with `@` unless they've previously expressed interest or involvement with that particular issue.
* Familiarize yourself with [this list of discussion anti-patterns](https://github.com/bradfitz/issue-tracker-behaviors) and make every effort to avoid them.

> [!CAUTION]
> We do not currently accept issues submitted via GitHub's API: All issues must be submitted using one of the [provided templates](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/new/choose). The templates not only help ensure high-quality submissions, but they also automatically assign issue types and labels for categorization. This does not happen when issues are submitted via the API.

## :bug: Reporting Bugs

:warning: Bug reports are used to call attention to some unintended or unexpected behavior in NetBox, such as when an error occurs or when the result of taking some action is inconsistent with the documentation. **Bug reports may not be used to suggest new functionality**; please see "feature requests" below if that is your goal.

* First, ensure that you're running the [latest stable version](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases) of NetBox. If you're running an older version, it's likely that the bug has already been fixed.

* Next, search our [issues list](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to see if the bug you've found has already been reported. If you come across a bug report that seems to match, please click "add a reaction" in the bottom left corner of the issue and add a thumbs up ( :thumbsup: ). This will help draw more attention to it. Any comments you can add to provide additional information or context would also be much appreciated.

* If you can't find any existing issues (open or closed) that seem to match yours, you're welcome to [submit a new bug report](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/new?label=type%3A+bug&template=bug_report.yaml). Be sure to complete the entire report template, including detailed steps that someone triaging your issue can follow to confirm the reported behavior. (If we're not able to replicate the bug based on the information provided, we'll ask for additional detail.)

* Some other tips to keep in mind:
  * Error messages and screenshots are especially helpful.
  * Don't prepend your issue title with a label like `[Bug]`; the proper label will be assigned automatically.
  * Ensure that your reproduction instructions don't reference data in our [demo instance](https://demo.netbox.dev/), which gets rebuilt nightly.
  * Verify that you have GitHub notifications enabled and are subscribed to your issue after submitting.
  * We appreciate your patience as bugs are prioritized by their severity, impact, and difficulty to resolve.

* For more information on how bug reports are handled, please see our [issue
intake policy](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/wiki/Issue-Intake-Policy).

## :bulb: Feature Requests

* First, check the GitHub [issues list](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to see if the feature you have in mind has already been proposed. If you happen to find an open feature request that matches your idea, click "add a reaction" in the top right corner of the issue and add a thumbs up ( :thumbsup: ). This ensures that the issue has a better chance of receiving attention. Also feel free to add a comment with any additional justification for the feature.

* Please don't submit duplicate issues! Sometimes we reject feature requests, for various reasons. Even if you disagree with those reasons, please **do not** submit a duplicate feature request. It is very disrespectful of the maintainers' time, and you may be barred from opening future issues.

* If you have a rough idea that's not quite ready for formal submission yet, start a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/discussions) instead. This is a great way to test the viability and narrow down the scope of a new feature prior to submitting a formal proposal, and can serve to generate interest in your idea from other community members.

* Once you're ready, submit a feature request [using this template](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/new?label=type%3A+feature&template=feature_request.yaml). Be sure to provide sufficient context and detail to convey exactly what you're proposing and why. The stronger your use case, the better chance your proposal has of being accepted.

* Some other tips to keep in mind:
  * Don't prepend your issue title with a label like `[Feature]`; the proper label will be assigned automatically.
  * Try to anticipate any likely questions about your proposal and provide that information proactively.
  * Verify that you have GitHub notifications enabled and are subscribed to your issue after submitting.
  * You're welcome to volunteer to implement your FR, but don't submit a pull request until it has been approved.

* For more information on how feature requests are handled, please see our [issue intake policy](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/wiki/Issue-Intake-Policy).

## :arrow_heading_up: Submitting Pull Requests

* [Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) (a feature of GitHub) are used to propose changes to NetBox's code base. Our process generally goes like this:
  * A user opens a new issue (bug report or feature request)
  * A maintainer triages the issue and may mark it as needing an owner
  * The issue's author can volunteer to own it, or someone else can
  * A maintainer assigns the issue to whomever volunteers
  * The issue owner submits a pull request that will resolve the issue
  * A maintainer reviews and merges the pull request, closing the issue

* It's very important that you not submit a pull request until a relevant issue has been opened **and** assigned to you. Otherwise, you risk wasting time on work that may ultimately not be needed.

* Community members are limited to a maximum of **three open PRs** at any time. This is to avoid the accumulation of too much parallel work and maintain focus on PRs already under review. If you already have three NetBox PRs open, please wait for at least one of them to be merged (or closed) before opening another.

* New pull requests should generally be based off of the `main` branch. This branch, in keeping with the [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) approach, is used for ongoing development and bug fixes and always represents the newest stable code, from which releases are periodically branched. (If you're developing for an upcoming minor release, use `feature` instead.)

* In most cases, it is not necessary to add a changelog entry: A maintainer will take care of this when the PR is merged. (This helps avoid merge conflicts resulting from multiple PRs being submitted simultaneously.)

* All code submissions must meet the following criteria (CI will enforce these checks where feasible):
  * Consist entirely of original work
  * Python syntax is valid
  * All tests pass when run with `NETBOX_CONFIGURATION=netbox.configuration_testing ./manage.py test`
  * `ruff check` successfully validates style compliance

> [!CAUTION]
> Any contributions which include solely AI-generated content will be rejected. All PRs must be submitted by a human.

* Some other tips to keep in mind:
  * If you'd like to volunteer for someone else's issue, please post a comment on that issue letting us know. (GitHub allows only people who have commented on an issue to be assigned as its owner.)
  * Check out our [developer docs](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/development/getting-started/) for tips on setting up your development environment.
  * All new functionality must include relevant tests where applicable.

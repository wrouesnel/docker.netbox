about: Propose a new NetBox feature or enhancement

---

<!--
    NOTE: This form is only for proposing specific new features or enhancements.
    If you have a general idea or question, please post to our mailing list
    instead of opening an issue:

        https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/netbox-discuss

    NOTE: Due to an excessive backlog of feature requests, we are not currently
    accepting any proposals which significantly extend NetBox's feature scope.

    Please describe the environment in which you are running NetBox. Be sure
    that you are running an unmodified instance of the latest stable release
    before submitting a bug report.
-->
### Environment
* Python version:  <!-- Example: 3.5.4 -->
* NetBox version:  <!-- Example: 2.3.6 -->

<!--
    Describe in detail the new functionality you are proposing. Include any
    specific changes to work flows, data models, or the user interface.
-->
### Proposed Functionality


<!--
    Convey an example use case for your proposed feature. Write from the
    perspective of a NetBox user who would benefit from the proposed
    functionality and describe how.
--->
### Use Case


<!--
    Note any changes to the database schema necessary to support the new
    feature. For example, does the proposal require adding a new model or
    field? (Not all new features require database changes.)
--->
### Database Changes


<!--
    List any new dependencies on external libraries or services that this new
    feature would introduce. For example, does the proposal require the
    installation of a new Python package? (Not all new features introduce new
    dependencies.)

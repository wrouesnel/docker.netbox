<!--
    NOTE: This form is only for reproducible bugs. If you need assistance with
    NetBox installation, or if you have a general question, DO NOT open an
    issue. Instead, post to our mailing list:

        https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/netbox-discuss

    Please describe the environment in which you are running NetBox. Be sure
    that you are running an unmodified instance of the latest stable release
    before submitting a bug report.
-->
### Environment
* Python version:  <!-- Example: 3.5.4 -->
* NetBox version:  <!-- Example: 2.5.2 -->

<!--
    Describe in detail the exact steps that someone else can take to reproduce
    this bug using the current stable release of NetBox (or the current beta
    release where applicable). Begin with the creation of any necessary
    database objects and call out every operation being performed explicitly.
    If reporting a bug in the REST API, be sure to reconstruct the raw HTTP
    request(s) being made: Don't rely on a wrapper like pynetbox.

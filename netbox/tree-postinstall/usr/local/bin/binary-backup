# Script which executes a binary backup and streams the result as a tar-formatted
# archive to stdout. This is invoked via the container API to take backups.

# Construct the tar archive in a streaming manner - backup the database first,
# then collect static files (the assumption being the most.

# The following set of hooks allow you to inline defer function and method calls
# in bash until the script terminates. It *requires* a line like 
# `trap "atexit_commands" INT TERM EXIT` in the body of the bash script in order to 
# work. Functions are a stack, and are executed in reverse order.
# Typical usage:
# trap "atexit_commands ; exit 0" INT TERM EXIT
# atexit echo "This is run at exit"
